# SGX general options

# size must be specified during signing. If OpenVINO needs more virtual memory
# than the enclave size, Gramine will not be able to allocate it.

# TCSes must be specified during signing, so the application cannot use more
# threads than the number of TCSes. Note that Gramine also creates an internal
# thread for handling inter-process communication (IPC), and potentially another
# thread for asynchronous events. Therefore, the actual number of threads that
# the application can create is (sgx.thread_num - 2).
